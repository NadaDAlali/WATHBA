## 🌟 Why WATHBA?

In football, setting fair salaries is tough. Most decisions rely on subjective opinions or old stats, which can lead to mistakes and wasted budgets.  
WATHBA changes this by using artificial intelligence to provide accurate, unbiased salary predictions based on the player’s actual performance, position, age, and contract length – all using up-to-date data from top football leagues.
